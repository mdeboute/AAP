### First report, **deadline: Friday, September 30th**

Write a small report (PDF file) explaining:

The construction of the graph: what are the vertices? the edges?
The formal statement of the problem: what is a typical instance (input, question)? -> We have to define all the notions used (for example, what is represented by a vertex?)
Explain and justify our choices (algorithmic and programming) in a few words! (We can insert some code if necessary).
How do we go from a solution of our graph problem to the coordinates (of the image) where to place the firefighter actions?
Any information that we consider useful is welcome.
